"""Confident source matching — never grab the wrong title/season.

A website search for "Naruto" can return a recap, a spin-off, or the wrong
season. To be certain we have the *exact* show, we search each source with BOTH
the AniList English and Romaji titles and only accept a result whose own title
strongly matches one of them (in both directions, so a season-2 superset doesn't
get mistaken for season 1).
